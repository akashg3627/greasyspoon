This project is a web application that enables all the IITI-ians to place our order from our favorite cafes, from your beloved smartphones and computers. We have used the MERN stack to build this web application. Crowded cafes of the campus have been inconvenient for all of us, and would also have been unsafe because of the current pandemic situation. This app will allow us to eat all the delicious food, while still maintaining social distancing. The app features two components, one for the users to view menus and place orders, and the other for the cafes to add, edit, delete dishes from their menu and receive orders. 

This site is created by second year students Akash, Dipin, Siddhesh and Harsh, as part of IITISoC 2020.
You can give feedback by contacting us, or better yet, contribute to the repository!

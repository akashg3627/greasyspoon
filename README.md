# Greasyspoon

We're digital nomads, living a digital life! And one thing that we have learned over the course of this evolution is that whatever we want or need, can be obtained with just a few clicks on our beloved smart devices. In this digital life we the students of IIT Indore have tried to make your life more simpler by making a Web App called Greasy Spoon which allows you to search for your favourite Cafe in the campus and their respective dishes. Crowded cafes of the campus have been inconvenient for all of us, and would also have been unsafe because of the current pandemic situation.
Greasy spoon allows you to order food online, keeping your safety and convenience in mind. Through this medium we can also receive your feedbacks for the dishes and particular cafe in our campus.
This site is created by second year students Akash, Dipin, Siddhesh and Harsh, as part of IITISoC 2020.
You can give feedback by contacting us, or better yet, contribute to the repository!
